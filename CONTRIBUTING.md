## Graphic Designers

There's a lot to do in matter of graphic design. Any contribution is welcome. You can follow on [this board](https://github.com/Faceplant-Games/epicslash/projects/1) the progress of the game graphics. You can take any task from the column [To do](https://github.com/Faceplant-Games/epicslash/projects/1#column-2712018). To help you, we labeled some tasks.
- good first issue: an easy task to begin with this project.
- creativity: a task with a great margin of artistic freedom in implementation. 

Just comment on the issue that you want to take and we'll assign it to you.
To have a general view of the project, you can take a look at the [General Board](https://trello.com/b/clnb9JpQ/epicslash-development). The Graphic Design cards are tagged in yellow.
